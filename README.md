## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates:
- A **from-scratch logistic regression** implementation (showing algorithm fundamentals).
- Applied **machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) with visualizations.
- **Model evaluation**: cross-validation, ROC & PR curves, confusion matrix, feature importance, calibration.
